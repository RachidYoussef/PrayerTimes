# CS50 Final Project-Prayer Times website

It was created with  HTML, CSS, Javascript, Prayer Times website was created as a final project to fulfill the requirements of Harvard's CS50 (Intro to Computer Science) course - Responsive.
I wanted to make a project like this to expand my knowledge of HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT and how to use API etc.

## Languages used
* HTML
* CSS
* JAVASCRIPT


## How the webpage works?

The webpage get the exact location with an API. Then using that location it calls another API that is resposible to get the prayer times based on that location.
All of this is linked and managed with a javascript file.

## How to launch?
